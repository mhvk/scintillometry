    important if the time shift represents a physical delay of the original

    This task is meant to be used for clock corrections, post-mixing
    cable delays, etc.

    ----------
    ih : task or `baseband` stream reader
        Input data stream, with time as the first axis.

        quantity with units of time.  Should broadcast to the sample shape.
    offset : float, `~astropy.units.Quantity`, or `~astropy.time.Time`

    Generally, the stream start time will change, by up to one sample, and
    the stream length reduced by one frame.  The precision with which the

    Parameters
    ----------
    ih : task or `baseband` stream reader
        Input data stream, with time as the first axis.
    offset : float, `~astropy.units.Quantity`, or `~astropy.time.Time`

    samples_per_frame : int, optional
        Number of samples which should be resampled in one go. The number of
        output samples per frame will be one less than this.  If not given,
        the larger of the sampler per frame in the underlying stream or 1024.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose one wanted to read the 8 samples surrounding a precise time::

      >>> from baseband_tasks.sampling import Resample
      >>> from astropy.time import Time
      >>> from baseband import data, vdif
      >>> fh = vdif.open(data.SAMPLE_VDIF)
      >>> texact = Time('2014-06-16T05:56:07.000123456')
      >>> ((texact - fh.start_time) * fh.sample_rate).to(1)
      ... # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
      <Quantity 3950.59201992>
      >>> rh = Resample(fh, texact)
      >>> rh.time.isot
      '2014-06-16T05:56:07.000123456'
      >>> rh.seek(-4, 1)
      3946
      >>> data = rh.read(8)
      >>> data[4]  # doctest: +SKIP

    For comparison, if one uses the underlying filehandle directly, one gets
    the data only at the approximate time::

      >>> fh.seek(texact)
      3951
      >>> fh.time.isot
      '2014-06-16T05:56:07.000123469'
